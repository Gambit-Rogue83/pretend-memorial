<h3>Death Has No Hold On Me</h3>

<p>Do not stand <br>
    By my grave, and weep. <br>
I am not there, <br>
    I do not sleep— <br>
I am the thousand winds that blow <br>
I am the diamond glints in snow <br>
I am the sunlight on ripened grain, <br>
I am the gentle, autumn rain. <br>
As you awake with morning’s hush, <br>
I am the swift, up-flinging rush <br>
Of quiet birds in circling flight, <br>
I am the day transcending night. <br>
Do not stand <br>
    By my grave, and cry— <br>
    I am not there, <br>
    I did not die.</p>

<article>In Loving Memory of CamCam: A Dynamic Duo's Journey

    It is with a mix of laughter and tears that we bid farewell to our dear friend, CamCam, who left in a blaze of glory that only he could orchestrate. For those of you who knew him, you're well aware that he lived life to the fullest, often dragging his partner in crime, Shak, along for the wild ride.

    From the early days of eating burritos/tacos by the pound, to countless lady flirting (often with questionable success rates), CamCam and Shak were an inseparable duo. Their friendship was built on a solid foundation of inappropriate jokes, profound wisdom (mostly acquired through trial and error), and a shared disdain for subtlety.

    Together, they murder mystery-ed, youth danced, and drove randomly (like a lot), In one of many instances of their incompetent driving skills on display CamCam nearly sent Shak to the great beyond by sliding off the road into a ditch. Only for Shak to return the favor on an icy hill next to the Wheelers' house, for those who know the story. If you ever wondered where they got their ideas from, the answer was probably fueled by late night taco bell food consumed in a poorly ventilated basement.

    As we celebrate CamCam's life, let's remember the laughter, the camaraderie, and the moments that pushed the boundaries of good taste. May he rest in Missouri where he exiled to, knowing that he left an impression on those who loved him, with a partner in crime who will never forget the adventures they shared.

    So raise a styrofoam cup of Sonic Slush in CamCam's honor. Cheers to CamCam – a man who truly knew how to make every moment the 'worst' thing possible.</article>
